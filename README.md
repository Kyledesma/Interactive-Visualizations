Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard Exercise!

This was one of my homework assignments where I utilized JS to build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The graphs update automatically based on the subject ID selected from the drop-down!
